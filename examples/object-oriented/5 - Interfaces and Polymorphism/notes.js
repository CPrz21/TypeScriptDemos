//? Interfaces
//* Act as a contract that defines a set of rules

//* Can be used to create custom data types

//* Classes can implement interfaces wich can help ensure consitency across an application by using the IMPLEMENTS keyword

//* Interfaces are only uses during development(no impact on script/bundle size)
//! Example
/**
 * interface IPerson {
 *  name: string;
 *  age: number;
 *  deposit(amount: number): void;
 * }
 */

//* Interfaces can be used as types to define the shape of data held ina property or 
//* that is passed to a function/method or contructor

 //? Polymorphism
//* Objects exhibit the same behavior but in a different way
